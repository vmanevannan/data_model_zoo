### Benefits of Setting Up Unity Catalog from Scratch:

- **Control and Customization**: Starting from scratch allows us to fully customize the catalog and schema architecture to fit an organization's needs.  


- **Data Governance**: Early setup of catalogs and schemas helps in implementing data governance practices right from the start. It lets us leverage features like data lineage, fine-grained permission controls, and auditing capabilities.


- **Resilient**: It's forgiving to change. By structuring our data environment early, we can scale more easily as data grows, adding more schemas and catalogs as needed without disrupting existing setups.
